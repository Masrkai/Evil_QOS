The program must be:
1 - Efficient & Memory Safe (provided by rust)

2 - Extremely fast in
   1 - Minimal overhead during spoofing
   2 - High packet processing/transfer rate

3 - Network Scope & Discovery
    1 - Automatic detection of the local network interface, IP, and subnet mask.
    2 - Methods for host discovery (e.g., ICMP ping sweep, ARP scan, port scan).
    3 - Handling of hosts on different subnets (if applicable).

4 - Able to selectively make victim internet bandwidth speed
    1 - 0 or None (connected but without internet bandwidth)
    2 - Number set by Attacker
    3 - Full Speed

5 - The program should be able to cherry pick users
    1 - one by one
    2 - actively scanning and limiting the entire or a group og the network range
        to a set value by Attacker

6 - The custom cap value for bandwidth should be expressed bu user natural language
    (Not strictly typed) expressing that it's not as in
    1 - 10 Kbit
    2 - 200 Kbits
    3 - 10 Mb
    4 - 4 MB/S
